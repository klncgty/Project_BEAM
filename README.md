# Project BEAM

In this project, i guide you through the process of converting PDF files to JSON format, performing data retrieval using Ragie.ai, and implementing similar operations locally. Below are the key steps and processes involved.

## üìù PDF to JSON Conversion

The first step involves converting our PDF files into JSON format.Because json format more suitable to reach all the priceses of materials correctly because of its dict format. When we search in the descr. retriver can get its price together like below.

We used the [camelot_convert_to_json.ipynb](https://github.com/klncgty/Project_BEAM/blob/main/advanced_file_extra/camelot_convert_to_json.ipynb) notebook located in the [advanced_file_ext](https://github.com/klncgty/Project_BEAM/tree/main/advanced_file_extra) folder to achieve this. This notebook provides all the necessary code to extract tables from PDF files and convert them into JSON format.

In [camelot.ipynb](https://github.com/klncgty/Project_BEAM/blob/main/advanced_file_extra/camelot.ipynb), you can see and apply converting process pdf to csv. you can rearrange the whole process.

### Steps:
1. **Extract Tables:** We extracted tables from the PDF using the Camelot library.
2. **Save as JSON:** Each table was saved as a temporary JSON file.
3. **Combine JSONs:** All JSON files were combined into a single `all_tables.json` file, ensuring that paragraph descriptions were kept intact without splitting sentences.
   !! However, some paragraphs may fail to put it together. If the resource is more configured, this problem may not occur. Or  maybe, some manupilations on csv tables, got from camelot , can be useful for not facing this issue. But ƒ± can state that this is not a big problem. !!

## üöÄ Operations in Ragie.ai

Once the PDF data is converted to JSON, we uploaded this JSON file to Ragie.ai for advanced data retrieval operations. Below are the key files and scripts used for these operations.

### JSON Uploading
- **Script:** [raige_uploading.py](https://github.com/klncgty/Project_BEAM/blob/main/ragie_main/raige_uploading.py)
- **Purpose:** This script uploads the JSON data to Ragie.ai, making it accessible for subsequent queries.

### Accessing Data
- **Script:** [reach_document.py](https://github.com/klncgty/Project_BEAM/blob/main/ragie_main/reach_document.py)
- **Purpose:** Allows you to access and retrieve data from the uploaded JSON file on Ragie.ai.
- You will have an output as below.
   ```
     {  "id": "64ca0a7b-2604-42dc-b22e-e54204ebb96d",
         "created_at": "2024-08-01T14:04:41.746519Z",
         "updated_at": "2024-08-01T14:17:07.294238Z",
         "status": "ready",
         "name": "EXAMPLE.pdf",
         "metadata": { "title": "YOUR_TITLE", "environment": "YOUR_ENV_NAME"},
         "chunk_count": 1942,
         "external_id": null}
    ```
### Query Execution
- **Script:** [query.py](https://github.com/klncgty/Project_BEAM/blob/main/ragie_main/query.py)
- **Purpose:** This script is used to execute queries against the JSON data on Ragie.ai, retrieving the most relevant results based on the search scores.
 

### Evaluating Results
- **Tutorial:** [Ragie.ai Tutorial](https://docs.ragie.ai/docs/tutorial)
- **Note:** The retrieved results are ranked based on relevance. You can enhance accuracy through trial and error by adjusting the `top_k` parameter.

## üîß Local Operations

In addition to the operations performed on Ragie.ai, similar processes can be executed locally using open-source tools and libraries. Below are the key scripts and methods used for local retrieval.

### Local Retriever Method
- **Folder:** [searchin_locally](https://github.com/klncgty/Project_BEAM/tree/main/searchin_locally)
- **Notebook:** [vector_search.ipynb](https://github.com/klncgty/Project_BEAM/blob/main/searchin_locally/vector_search.ipynb)
- **Purpose:** This notebook replicates the Ragie.ai operations locally. It uses open-source tools to perform vector searches, allowing for more customizable and experimental retrieval processes.

### Customization
- **Flexibility:** The local approach allows for more parameter tweaks and the use of alternative technologies to achieve the best possible results. This method is ideal for testing and optimizing retrieval strategies.

### Results based on the type of source file.
 ````
```
  When working on PDFs, search results are not efficient in terms of price. Because the unit price of the target material cannot be reached.
